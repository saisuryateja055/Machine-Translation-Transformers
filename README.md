# English-to-Telugu Transformer

## Overview
This repository contains a Transformer-based machine translation model developed from scratch using PyTorch. It is designed to translate text from English to Telugu. The model was built and trained using a custom dataset in Google Colab, without relying on pre-trained models.

## Model Architecture
The model uses the Transformer architecture, a deep learning model introduced in the paper "Attention is All You Need". It consists of multiple layers of self-attention and point-wise, fully connected layers for both the encoder and decoder.

## Dataset
The dataset used for training comprises parallel corpora of English and Telugu sentences. (Include more details about the dataset, such as the number of sentences, source, any preprocessing done, etc.)

## Features
- **Transformer Architecture**: Utilizes self-attention mechanisms that make it highly effective for sequence-to-sequence tasks like machine translation.
- **Built from Scratch**: Fully implemented in PyTorch without the use of pre-existing model weights.
- **Google Colab**: Developed and trained in Google Colab, leveraging its powerful GPUs for efficient training.

## Technologies Used
- **PyTorch**: For implementing and training the neural network.
- **Google Colab**: For leveraging cloud GPUs for training.
