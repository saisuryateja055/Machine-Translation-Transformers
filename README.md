## Machine Translation from English to Telugu using Transformers
This repository contains a Transformer model built from scratch using PyTorch in Jupyter Notebooks to translate text from English to Telugu. The project explores the capabilities of Transformers in natural language processing, specifically in the domain of machine translation.

## Project Overview
The implementation of this Transformer model demonstrates the application of deep learning techniques to the task of machine translation. By translating English sentences to Telugu, the project aims to contribute to the growing field of computational linguistics using state-of-the-art models.

## Features
Transformer model custom-built using PyTorch.
Usage of Colab for step-by-step implementation.
